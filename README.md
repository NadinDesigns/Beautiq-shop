# 🛍️ Beautiq App

An elegant frontend for an online beauty store — built with React.

## ✨ Project Overview

**Beautiq App** is a frontend-only e-commerce website designed for a beauty and nail products shop. This project was created as part of my frontend learning journey to practice building a modular layout with React components, routing, and adaptive styling.

The website includes product categories, promotional sections, and informational pages — all styled consistently and organized for potential scaling (e.g. product listings, future backend integration, etc.).

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **React (Create React App)**
- **HTML5 / JSX**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Git & GitHub**

## 📸 Features

- Responsive layout
- Category sections with images and descriptions
